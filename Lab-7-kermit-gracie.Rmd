Gracie's first message in the document. Hi Gage.

If you are the collaborator
- load the tidyverse
- read in the kermit data as 'kermit'
- make some side-by-side histograms of the Score.pre for all respondents, separated by the Gender column

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

kermit <- read_csv("kermit.csv")
```

```{r}
kermit_hist <- ggplot(kermit, aes(x = Score.pre)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 4) +
  facet_wrap(~Gender)

kermit_hist
```
